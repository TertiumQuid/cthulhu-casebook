                Madness, or wakefulness? Madness, or insight? Madness, or escape? Madness, or refuge? Madness, or immunity? Madness, or freedom? Madness, or enlightenment? Madness, or power? Madness, or greatness? Madness, or godhood? 

                When the struggle within subsides and you muster some fractured composure by counting buttons on the asylum cell walls, it occurs to you that a frightful interim must have passed to judge from the unrecognizable shape of your trembling rawboned form.

                You were worse when they found you, but will anyone believe your tale, or that you have moved beyond it? And if not, will anyone believe your lies?

                Your blood runs free, your bones are scree, your eyes are filled with blackness. The god of pain has named your name and burnt your soul to ashes.

                After an eternity of suffering in the purgatory of the half-dead you become aware, only over the course of weeks, that forms and lights are taking shape and deafness giving to a murmur of voices. In fact, you are no corpse or shade but consigned to hospital for recovery.

                You can't move or speak, and it's worrisome that the orderlies seem unable to look directly at you and perform their few small tasks with barely-stifled fear. Will you be trapped here until your final days a shunned and helpless ward?
