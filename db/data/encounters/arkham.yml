    title: Homecoming
    location: arkham
    description: It has been many years since you left your redolent childhood home, and the interval has weakened you to its strange power. The outside world falls away as you enter up Rivertown, through French Hill, and pass into the mist-dimmed heart of the city.
    
                 Enticed back to Arkham country (at troubling personal expense) by a sinister anonymous telegram, you find precious little in the words to guide your next steps; you read - 
                 
                 PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. 
                 RETURN TO ARKHAM AT ONCE OR RISK EVERYTHING.
                 THE STARS ARE RIGHT.
                 
                 Yet the nonsense somehow rings true. Surely among the hidden places of Arkham, armed as you are with skill and insight unique to your age, you can uncover clues into the nature of the mysterious dispatch.
