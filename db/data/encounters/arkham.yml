    title: Homecoming
    location: arkham
    description: It has been many years since you left your redolent childhood home, and the interval has weakened you to its strange power. The outside world falls away as you enter up Rivertown, through French Hill, and pass into the mist-dimmed heart of the city.
    
                 Enticed back to Arkham country (at troubling personal expense) by a sinister anonymous telegram, you find precious little in the words to guide your next steps; you read - 
                 
                 PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. 
                 RETURN TO ARKHAM AT ONCE OR RISK EVERYTHING.
                 THE STARS ARE RIGHT.
                 
                 Yet the nonsense somehow rings true. Surely among the hidden places of Arkham, armed as you are with skill and insight unique to your age, you can uncover clues into the nature of the mysterious dispatch.

    title: A Glimpse in the First Baptist Church Archives
    location: arkham    
    description: The First Baptist gained much its wealth and prestige under the stewardship of Reverend Ward Phillips over 100 years ago. When he died, his considerable collection of early mystic Christian literature and personal research was transferred to the private church vault. Among this collection is the Reverend's own work - Thaumaturgical Prodigies in the New England Canaan - which represents only a summary of the curious scholar's meticulous legacy. A friend of the church such as yourself can request a private reading (with chaparone).

Reverend Noyes desires to put the matter to rest and bids you investigate the church so long shunned by Arkham's good sons and daughters.
