    title: Die Geheimnisvollen Wurm
    language: german
    author: Johann Lindenmuth
    publication_date: 1670
    description: A imaginatively Teutonic interpretation of the Saracenic rituals discovered by the demonologist Ludwig Prinn.
    
                 This copy comes down from innumerable hand translations, and as such should be expected to contain serious ommissions and mistakes apt to become apparent during the final moments of a ceremony or in the midst of negotiations with diablic forces.
                 
                 But for those willing to risk everything for a chance to conjure some cosmic thing, Die Geheimnisvollen Wurm will not disapoint, for such is the boundless compass of the ritual secrets described within that all things are possible.
